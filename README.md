# Py_Concepts_Lambda
#Lambda functions are explained in a easy way in this code. 
#The code is in both .py and .ipynb files.
#There are 2 simple code examples to explain lambda syntax and one simple program to solve the following exercise:
#Write a program to rearrange positive and negative numbers in a given list L1 using lambda.
#L1=[-10, -4, 6, 8, -3, 7, 3, -9]
